# Contributing

[Pending]

## TODO

No contribution guidelines have been drafted yet, but here is a list of things
that are currently being worked on or should eventually receive attention:

- Finishing the [proxy-wasm](https://github.com/proxy-wasm/spec) HTTP specification.
- Consider a build process with [Bazel](https://bazel.build/).
- Implement configuration directives for the Wasm runtimes.
- Implement a `wasm_log` directive with Wasm-only logs.
- Load Wasm bytecode at runtime (consider a dedicated nginx process type?).

## Building from source

See [DEVELOPER.md](DEVELOPER.md) for developer resources on building this module
from source and other general development processes.
