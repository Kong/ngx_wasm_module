The nginx executable is a pre-compiled Nginx binary which includes
ngx_wasm_module as an addon.

Verify the binary:

    $ ./nginx -V

Start nginx with:

    $ ./nginx

This will start nginx using the current directory as a prefix (i.e. working
directory). See nginx.conf for configuration.

Stop nginx with:

    $ ./nginx -s stop
