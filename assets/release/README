The nginx executable is a pre-compiled Nginx binary which includes
ngx_wasm_module as an addon.

Verify the binary:

    $ ./nginx -V

Start Nginx with:

    $ ./nginx

This will start Nginx using the current directory as a prefix (i.e. working
directory). See nginx.conf for configuration.

Stop Nginx with:

    $ ./nginx -s stop

For ngx_wasm_module usage instructions, consult the repository's extended
documentation (mind your release version):
